Question 1: Using Recursive CTE , select Numbers from 1 to 10: 

WITH Numbers AS ( 
SELECT 1 AS Number 
UNION ALL 
SELECT Number + 1 AS Number
FROM Numbers
WHERE Number  < 10
)
SELECT * FROM Numbers;


Question-2: Using Recursive CTE , display employee their maanger Id and their level of hirearchy

Answer: 

-- Insert some sample data
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #Employees; 
CREATE TABLE #Employees ( EmployeeID   INT ,  EmployeeName NVARCHAR(MAX), ManagerID INT)
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, EmployeeName, ManagerID)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', NULL),
       (2, 'Bob', 1),
       (3, 'Charlie', 2),
       (4, 'David', 2),
       (5, 'Emma', 4);




-- Query to recursively retrieve employee hierarchy
WITH RecursiveEmployeeCTE AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, ManagerID, 0 AS Level
    FROM #Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeName, e.ManagerID, rec.Level + 1
    FROM #Employees e
    INNER JOIN RecursiveEmployeeCTE rec ON e.ManagerID = rec.EmployeeID
)
SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, ManagerID, Level
FROM RecursiveEmployeeCTE
ORDER BY Level, EmployeeID;
